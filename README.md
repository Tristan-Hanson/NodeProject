# Node README Project
## Description
In this project I made a program that when prompted I can create a new README file.
## Motivation
The motivation was finding an easier solution to creating a README file, rather that generating one from scratch.
## What I wanted to solve
The problem was generating a readme file for every project proved to be time consuming and rather annoying. With this I can easily generate a new file with only answering a few simple questions.
## What I learned
With this project I learned a lot about the basics of node and how it can be used in code.
## What makes my project stand out
I think that what makes my project different from others, is it is very portable. If I eventually want to add more information to my readme file I can do so by adding a few simple lines of code.
